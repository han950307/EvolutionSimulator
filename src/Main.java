		// See if the animal species diverge and specialize.
		
		// 2. Start with low hanging fruits, and then raise the bar.
		// This should show why there are no intermediary species.
		
		// Another way is to start with shrubbery eating species
		// Then introduce tall fruit bearing trees into the environment
		// that outcompetes the shrubbery (due to blockage of sunlight)
		// and see if speciation occurs.
